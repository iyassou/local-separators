        Given a graph :math:`G` and :math:`r\in\mathbb{N}\cup\left\lbrace\infty\right\rbrace`,
        math:`v\in V(G)` is an :math:`r`-local cutvertex if the ball of radius :math:`\frac{r}{2}` with :math:`v` removed is
        disconnected.

        If :math:`v` is a local cutvertex, then :math:`B_{\frac{r}{2}}(v)-v` contains :math:`c>1` components, and so
        :math:`B_{\frac{r}{2}}(v)` contains edges going from :math:`v` to the vertices in these :math:`c` components, effectively
        forming a partition of :math:`E_G(v)` in :math:`G`.
        
        We keep track of this edge-partition as well as the radius so as to enable splitting at a local cutvertex, an operation
        detailed below. Note that we only need to store :math:`u\in V(G)` for :math:`uv\in E_G(v)` since it is implicit that the
        edge's other end is in fact :math:`v`.

            The locality of the local cutvertex.
        edge_partition: List[Tuple[Vertex, ...]]

        The aforementioned components are supplemented with 'local component tags',
        which at the moment are just integers, but can be anything else (think names).
        These local component tags allow the visualisation function to distinguish the
        local components when rendering the graph, in order to actually demonstrate
        structural insight into the local cutvertex.

        The split vertices are given names according to _split_naming_convention, where
