        Given a graph :math:`G` and :math:`r\in\mathbb{N}\cup\left\lbrace\infty\right\rbrace`, math:`v\in V(G)` is an
        :math:`r`-local cutvertex if the ball of radius :math:`\frac{r}{2}` with :math:`v` removed is disconnected.

        If :math:`v` is a local cutvertex, then :math:`B_{\frac{r}{2}}(v)-v` contains :math:`c>1` components, and so
        :math:`B_{\frac{r}{2}}(v)` contains edges going from :math:`v` to the vertices in these :math:`c` components,
        effectively forming a partition of :math:`E_G(v)` in :math:`G`.
        
        We keep track of this edge-partition as well as the radius so as to enable splitting at a local cutvertex, an
        operation detailed below. Note that we only need to store :math:`u\in V(G)` for :math:`uv\in E_G(v)` since it
        is implicit that the edge's other end is in fact :math:`v`.

        Notes
        -----
        Splitting at a vertex :math:`v` with a radius :math:`r` equates to supplying the
        components of the :math:`B_{\frac{r}{2}}(v)-v` with unique copies of the vertex, and
        subsequently adding edges between :math:`v` and its numbered copies.

        Although this is correct and not error-prone for splitting at a single local cutvertex,
        obtaining the punctured balls while also introducing split vertices as we split at
        multiple local cutvertices is error-prone, as the introduction of the split vertices
        would modify the underlying graph.
        Specifically, an issue that can arise is if a local cutvertex :math:`v` is in the
        punctured ball of another local cutvertex :math:`w`, then splitting at :math:`v` first
        would modify the ball we'd obtain around :math:`w` because of the newly introduced
        split vertices.
        To remedy this, we instead introduce split vertices by operating on the edge-partition
        of each local cutvertex, which is a standalone approach in that it doesn't affect the
        other local cutvertices.

        The split vertices are given names according to _split_naming_convention, where
        identifier is an increasing integer index, starting at 1.
        Split vertices are tagged with a 'split' attribute set to True.
